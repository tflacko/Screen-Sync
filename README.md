# Screen Sync

Decentralized peer-to-peer advertising marketplace built on Solana blockchain.

## Overview

Screen Sync eliminates intermediaries in digital advertising by enabling direct transactions between advertisers and ad space owners through smart contracts. The platform leverages Solana's high throughput and low transaction costs to create an efficient marketplace for advertising inventory.

## Architecture

The system implements a trustless marketplace where participants can list, discover, and transact advertising space without centralized control. Smart contracts handle escrow, verification, and settlement while maintaining transparency across all operations.

## Technical Stack

- Solana blockchain for transaction processing
- Anchor framework for smart contract development
- React frontend with TypeScript
- Web3.js for blockchain interaction
- Solana Wallet Adapter for authentication

## Core Components

### Smart Contracts
- Marketplace contract for listing and transaction management
- Escrow system for secure fund handling
- Anti-fraud mechanisms for transaction validation
- Governance contract for protocol parameters

### Frontend Application
- Marketplace interface for browsing and creating listings
- Wallet integration for transaction signing
- Real-time data synchronization with blockchain state
- Analytics dashboard for performance tracking

## Development Status

Current focus: Phase 1 marketplace minimum viable product implementation including core smart contracts, basic user interface, and fundamental transaction flows.

## Token Economics

Native token SSC serves as platform currency for transactions, governance participation, and fee payments. Total supply of 3 billion tokens with proof-of-stake governance model. Will evolve to new model at end of 4 year period.(Po-AI)

## Network Deployment

Primary deployment on Solana mainnet with devnet testing environment. Future considerations for cross-chain compatibility pending protocol maturation.

## Contributing

Follow standard Git workflow with feature branches. All changes require test coverage and documentation updates. Smart contract modifications require additional security review.
